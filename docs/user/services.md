# Services

## Concepts
Services are IT resources that can be linked to projects, the main purpose is to keep track of which services are used by which projects, and who is responsible for them in order to contact the right people when issues arise.

A service represents a deployment unit from the user perspective (for example a docker compose stack), but can be implemented using multiple resources (a database, a web server, a frontend, a bucket, etc..)
