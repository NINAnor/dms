# Users

## Login
Users can log in using their institutional credentials via SSO (Single Sign-On). This ensures secure access and simplifies the login process.

## Synchronization
Users are also automatically synchronized from the user directory using LDAP/LDAPs. This means that changes in SOME of the user information are reflected in the DMS without manual intervention.
